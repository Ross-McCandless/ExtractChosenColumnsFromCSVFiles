# ExtractChosenColumnsFromCSVFiles

Have you ever needed to extract certain columns from multiple CSV files within a directory? With this script you can specify the header names you want to extract and have the columns extracted to a xls file. It basically looks for any .csv files in the folder you choose and then checks for matches in the headers list and then extracts only columns with matching headers to the Extraction.xls file.
